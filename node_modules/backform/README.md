Backform
========

Backform takes a Backbone model and transforms it into an HTML form.
Any changes to the form are reflected back to the model and vice versa.
It comes with built-in controls for input, select, radio buttons, checkbox, etc.
Backform controls are Backbone views and extensible.
Backform even supports nested objects.
Backform is built with Bootstrap 3 markup. Supports Bootstrap 2.3. Adaptable to any markup framework.
